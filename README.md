# ðŸ§¾ Tax-Saver
<p>This program takes the input of the user's tax income and the amount invested in various funds, schemes, and loans. The taxable income is calculated by subtracting the total investment from the tax income. The tax is then calculated based on the taxable income and the percentage of tax saved is calculated and printed.</p>
